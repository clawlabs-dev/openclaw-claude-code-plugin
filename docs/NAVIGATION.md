## All Documentation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | **Name:** `openclaw-claude-code-plugin` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. |
| `README.md` | > **ClawLabs Fork** — maintained at [`clawlabs-dev/openclaw-claude-code-plugin`](https://github.com/clawlabs-dev/openclaw-claude-code-plugin). |
| `docs/AGENT_CHANNELS.md` | `agentChannels` is a configuration map that binds **workspace directories** to **notification channels**. When a Claude Code session finishes, encounters an error, or needs user input, the plugin must know _where_ to send the notification. In a single-agent setup a hardcoded fallback is enough, but the moment you run **multiple agents** — each with its own Telegram bot, its own chat, and its own project directory — you need a way to route notifications to the right place. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | OpenClaw plugin that enables AI agents to orchestrate Claude Code sessions from messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Rocket.Chat). Agents can spawn, monitor, resume, and manage Claude Code as background development tasks. |
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | ``` |
| `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` | **P0** = blocking work · **P1** = visible defect · **P2** = nice-to-have |
| `docs/NAVIGATION.md` | > Auto-generated by `doc-nav-update.sh`. Last updated: 2026-02-24 11:34:07 |
| `docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md` | Sent by SessionManager via `openclaw message send` (fire-and-forget). |
| `docs/safety.md` | When an agent calls the `claude_launch` tool, **4 mandatory guards** run before any session is spawned. If any check fails, the launch is blocked with a clear, actionable error message — and the agent either fixes it automatically or gives you a one-liner to run. |
| `docs/SESSION_MANAGER_IMPROVEMENTS.md` | _(no description)_ |
| `docs/tools.md` | All tools provided by the OpenClaw Claude Code plugin. Each tool is exposed to agents via the OpenClaw tool system. |
