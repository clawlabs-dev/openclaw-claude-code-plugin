# OpenClaw plugin to orchestrate Claude Code

> **ClawLabs Fork** — maintained at [`clawlabs-dev/openclaw-claude-code-plugin`](https://github.com/clawlabs-dev/openclaw-claude-code-plugin).
> Upstream: [`alizarion/openclaw-claude-code-plugin`](https://github.com/alizarion/openclaw-claude-code-plugin).

Orchestrate Claude Code sessions as managed background processes from any OpenClaw channel.

Launch, monitor, and interact with multiple Claude Code SDK sessions directly from Telegram, Discord, or any OpenClaw-supported platform — without leaving your chat interface.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install @betrue/openclaw-claude-code-plugin
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 2. Configure notifications (minimal)

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.config["openclaw-claude-code-plugin"]`:

```json
{
  "fallbackChannel": "telegram|my-bot|123456789",
  "maxSessions": 5
}
```

### 3. Launch your first session

Ask your agent: *"Fix the bug in auth.ts"*

On first launch, the plugin runs **4 safety checks** and guides you through one-time setup:

1. **Answer an autonomy question** — tell the agent how much freedom Claude Code gets
2. **Run a heartbeat config command** — paste the `jq` one-liner the agent provides
3. **Restart the gateway** — `openclaw gateway restart`

That's it. Future launches skip setup entirely.

## Features

- **Multi-session management** — Run multiple concurrent sessions, each with a unique ID and human-readable name
- **Foreground / background model** — Sessions run in background by default; bring any to foreground to stream output in real time, with catchup of missed output
- **Real-time notifications** — Get notified on completion, failure, or when Claude asks a question
- **Multi-turn conversations** — Send follow-up messages, interrupt, or iterate with a running agent
- **Session resume & fork** — Resume any completed session or fork it into a new conversation branch
- **4 pre-launch safety checks** — Autonomy skill, heartbeat config, HEARTBEAT.md, and channel mapping
- **Multi-agent support** — Route notifications to the correct agent/chat via workspace-based channel mapping
- **Automatic cleanup** — Completed sessions garbage-collected after 1 hour; IDs persist for resume

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `claude_launch` | Start a new Claude Code session in background |
| `claude_respond` | Send a follow-up message to a running session |
| `claude_fg` | Bring a session to foreground — stream output in real time |
| `claude_bg` | Send a session back to background — stop streaming |
| `claude_kill` | Terminate a running session |
| `claude_output` | Read buffered output from a session |
| `claude_sessions` | List all sessions with status and progress |
| `claude_stats` | Show usage metrics (counts, durations, costs) |

All tools are also available as **chat commands** (`/claude`, `/claude_fg`, etc.) and most as **gateway RPC methods**.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Launch a session
/claude Fix the authentication bug in src/auth.ts
/claude --name fix-auth Fix the authentication bug

# Monitor
/claude_sessions
/claude_fg fix-auth
/claude_bg fix-auth

# Interact
/claude_respond fix-auth Also add unit tests
/claude_respond --interrupt fix-auth Stop that and do this instead

# Lifecycle
/claude_kill fix-auth
/claude_resume fix-auth Add error handling
/claude_resume --fork fix-auth Try a different approach
/claude_stats
```

## Notifications

The plugin sends real-time notifications to your chat based on session lifecycle events:

| Emoji | Event | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| ↩️ | Launched | Session started successfully |
| 🔔 | Claude asks | Session is waiting for user input — includes output preview |
| ↩️ | Responded | Follow-up message delivered to session |
| ✅ | Completed | Session finished successfully |
| ❌ | Failed | Session encountered an error |
| ⛔ | Killed | Session was manually terminated |

Foreground sessions stream full output in real time. Background sessions only send lifecycle notifications.

## Configuration

Set values in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `plugins.config["openclaw-claude-code-plugin"]`.

### Essential parameters

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `agentChannels` | `object` | — | Map workdir paths → notification channels |
| `fallbackChannel` | `string` | — | Default channel when no workspace match found |
| `maxSessions` | `number` | `5` | Maximum concurrent sessions |
| `maxAutoResponds` | `number` | `10` | Max consecutive auto-responds before requiring user input |
| `defaultBudgetUsd` | `number` | `5` | Default budget per session (USD) |
| `permissionMode` | `string` | `"bypassPermissions"` | `"default"` / `"plan"` / `"acceptEdits"` / `"bypassPermissions"` |
| `skipSafetyChecks` | `boolean` | `false` | Skip ALL pre-launch safety guards (autonomy skill, heartbeat, HEARTBEAT.md, agentChannels). For dev/testing only. |

### Example

```json
{
  "maxSessions": 3,
  "defaultBudgetUsd": 10,
  "defaultModel": "sonnet",
  "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions",
  "fallbackChannel": "telegram|main-bot|123456789",
  "agentChannels": {
    "/home/user/agent-seo": "telegram|seo-bot|123456789",
    "/home/user/agent-main": "telegram|main-bot|123456789"
  }
}
```

# Coding Agent Orchestrator

## Auto-response rules

When a Claude Code session asks a question, analyze and decide:

### Auto-respond (use `claude_respond` immediately):
- Permission requests for file reads, writes, or bash commands -> "Yes, proceed."
- Confirmation prompts like "Should I continue?" -> "Yes, continue."

### Forward to user:
- Architecture decisions (Redis vs PostgreSQL, REST vs GraphQL...)
- Destructive operations (deleting files, dropping tables...)
- Anything involving credentials, secrets, or production environments

## Workflow
1. User sends a coding task -> `claude_launch(prompt, ...)`
2. Session runs in background. Monitor via wake events.
3. On wake event -> `claude_output` to read the question, then auto-respond or forward.
4. On completion -> summarize the result and notify the user.
```

A comprehensive orchestration skill is available at [`skills/claude-code-orchestration/SKILL.md`](skills/claude-code-orchestration/SKILL.md).

### What the ClawLabs fork adds

Beyond the upstream plugin, the ClawLabs stack provides:

- **Workflow orchestration** — Boris-Cherny-style planning, verification, and sub-agent strategy baked into every session via `james-workflow-plugin`
- **Self-improvement loop** — Corrections auto-captured to `tasks/lessons.md` and bubbled to global `hard-won-lessons.md`
- **Session lifecycle management** — `lifecycle-hooks` fires capability-sync and state-flush hooks on session end and before compaction
- **Parallel Codex + Claude sessions** — `openclaw-codex-plugin` runs Codex CLI sessions alongside Claude Code for task routing by type
- **Auto-release pipeline** — All repos have GH Actions that create releases on version bumps; CHANGELOG maintained per Keep-a-Changelog
